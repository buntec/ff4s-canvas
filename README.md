Create [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)-based interactive charts the purely functional way.

This is an experimental companion library to [ff4s](https://www.github.com/buntec/ff4s).

Currently only supports Scala 3. No releases yet but you can try a snapshot:

```
Global / resolvers += "Sonatype S01 OSS Snapshots" at "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
```

## Examples

Try the examples by running `examples/fastLinkJS` in sbt and serving
the `index.html` in the `examples` folder using something
like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
