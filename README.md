# ff4s-canvas

Create canvas-based interactive charts in a purely functional way.

This is a small companion library to [ff4s](https://www.github.com/buntec/ff4s).

Try the examples by running `examples/fastLinkJS` in sbt and serving
the `index.html` in the `examples` folder using something
like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
